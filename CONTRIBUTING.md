How to design an About page
Below are a series of steps you can take to create an effective, compelling, and engaging About page:

1. Offer your mission statement
Including a sincere mission statement is a highly effective way to show the brand's values in a straightforward way. A good mission statement is succinct and states the company's goals at the beginning of the About page. You can explain in this statement what the organization aims to achieve and relate to any interest the visitor may have. This mission statement can leave a customer with the key points you want them to remember about what the company tries to achieve.

2. Share the company's history
Sharing the business's history provides an insight for visitors into where it began, how far it's come, and the people who made it succeed. Even small and young businesses, or those which haven't yet experienced many changes, can benefit from sharing their story with the public. This section can be as short as a sentence or two, or as long as a paragraph.

In this part, it's wise to focus only on the defining milestones the business has achieved, and avoid including fluff or irrelevant information. This means that the reader can easily learn the key points of the company's story without losing interest.

3. Share customer stories, media coverage, and awards
The About page is a useful place to share any awards or achievements the company has earned in its lifetime. This can have a positive effect on the perception a visitor has of the brand. If you don't have any award icons you can place, you can include links to press coverage or favourable articles about the business. Customer stories and social media pages can also be helpful links to include to give visitors a broader context for the brand's presence.

4. Explain who the company helps
This is a key step in describing the brand's key demographic to make sure that the company reaches its core customers. Doing so helps visitors understand if the organization is able to help them or if they require alternative products or services. Be careful to not be too restrictive in describing the demographic, as this can deter potential customers. For example, describing a demographic of entry-level software developers is less restrictive than describing one of young entry level software developers who live in cities.

5. Introduce the team
The About page is a key area to introduce the key team members, such as the CEO, key department managers, or staff in customer-facing roles. Including an image of each listed staff member's face is helpful to display on the About page. This means that visitors may recognize individuals they've interacted with, or put a face to a name of someone with which they may yet correspond.

If you don't want to list each member's face, you can even place a candid image of a team working together in the same industry. This can be a stock photo for illustrative purposes, which still helps to personalize the About page.

6. State the facts
Including impressive facts where relevant can be a compelling element in an About page. For instance, you can include helpful data such as growth metrics to show visitors how the business has increased its reach over a defined time period. If the company is an industry leader, it's wise to include facts that prove this if you wish to impress visitors.

7. Include links and CTA
The next useful component to add to an About page is important links and calls-to-action, or CTAs. A call-to-action is a directive opportunity for a visitor to take a particular action or interact in some way. For instance, a common call-to-action on About pages is a statement such as Check out our social media channels for examples of our service! Other examples of links and CTAs include:

Link for products
Link to blog
Link to apply for jobs
Link to sign up for company newsletter
Link to social media
8. Showcase your business model or process
In some cases, businesses may also choose to include their business model on the company's About page. This is especially common when the company's supply chain reinforces the brand's values, such as sourcing a local workforce, or being environmentally friendly. This is another helpful way to provide information that visitors may find favourable and endearing. The About page is also an effective place to share details about any charitable donations the business has made, or jobs it provides.
